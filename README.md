In this repository we are using Python as our main language to code a game practicing basic math problems. It will contain problems about addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(x), division(:). Written by me on February 6th 2024.

### Requirements

This is all the things you need to know before coding this.

- If elif else
- Def function
- While for loop
